 JavaScript CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application with Local Storage
This repository contains a JavaScript application that demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using local storage. The application allows users to input data such as name, age, address, and email, which is then stored in the browser's local storage. Users can add new data, view existing data in a table format, update data, and delete data entries.

Key Features:

Create new data entries by providing name, age, address, and email.
Display existing data entries in a table format.
Update data entries with the ability to modify name, age, address, and email fields.
Delete specific data entries from the local storage.
This application is a simple demonstration of how to implement a CRUD functionality using JavaScript and leverage local storage for data persistence within the browser. It can serve as a foundation for similar projects or as a learning resource for JavaScript developers interested in understanding local storage usage in web applications.
